## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository for the assignment.

## Project setup

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ pnpm run start

# watch mode
$ pnpm run start:dev

# production mode
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

## Run with Docker

To run the application using Docker, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. Then, from the root of the project, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will build the Docker image if it doesn't exist and start the application.

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ pnpm run test

# e2e tests
$ pnpm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ pnpm run test:cov
```
